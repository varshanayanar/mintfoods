            <p>  Millets are a group of highly variable grasses with small seeds. Its one of
the ancient foods used and domestication occurred 5000 or more years
ago in the savannah south of the Sahara, and west of the Nile. The protein
content of pearl millet ranges from 8 to 19%, and there is better amino acid
balance than in sorghum. The vitamin content of pearl millet is close to
sorghum. </p>

          <p>    Farro, also known as ‘hulled wheats’ (einkorn, emmer and spelt) are among
  the most ancient cereal crops of the Mediterranean region. These cereals
  were popular within the region for hundreds of years and remained a staple
  food for a long time. Spelt is a hexaploid species cultivated in limited
  quantities. It originates from hexaploid wheats (T. aestivum) and of the
  three farro types mentioned, its cultivation started approximately 8,000
  years ago. Just like T. monococcum, T. spelta produces a clear flour and is
  used for making bread, cakes, biscuits and pizza. Compared to einkorn and
  emmer, spelt is more productive and is also grown in lowland areas. </p>

  principal cereal food of North Africa, the Sahara, and the Sahel. In North
  Africa and in the Niger inland delta, couscous is prepared from wheat,
  whereas in the Sahel it is prepared from pearl millet or sorghum. Couscous
  can be prepared directly into a steamed product that is eaten with a sauce
  or used in place of cereal or salads. It can be steamed, sun dried, stored
  indefinitely, and reconstituted in milk, or again steamed and served with a
  sauce. </p>

    produce bulgur, Triticum durum is used that is processed using cleaning,
    cooking, drying, dehulling, grinding and classification operations. It is the
    most popularly used grain in Turkey, Arabic and East European countries.  </p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>    Quinoa is one of the oldest crops of the Andes, being cultivated for at least
7000 years. The pre-Inca cultures recognized from very early times the
high nutritional value of quinoa. Consumption of quinoa replaced animal
proteins, and in many areas, it continues to be one of the principal protein
sources. The protein quality of quinoa is very high, with a balanced amino
acid composition similar to casein, the protein of milk Biological value has
been found to be higher in quinoa than casein, Quinoa oil is high in
essential fatty acids, with 48% oleic acid, 50.7% linoleic acid, 0.8% linoleuic
acid, and only 0.4% saturated acids. In addition, quinoa has a high content
of calcium, magnesium, iron, copper, and zinc. </p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>    Wild rice is in the grass family of plants. Wild rice caryopses are the fruits of
the plant. The
caryopsis is similar to kernels of the cereal grain. The crude fiber
percentage of wild rice is similar to that of brown rice and oats but is half
that of wheat and corn. The total carbohydrate percentage of wild rice is
similar to that of other grains except rice, which has a slightly higher

percentage. Wild rice appears to be comparable in nutritive value with the
common cereals. The amino acid composition of the protein in wild rice is
similar to that of oat groats but has a higher protein quality.  </p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>    Buckwheat has major potential as food ingredient, especially for the
functional food industry. Buckwheat, a pseudo-cereal, contains protein of
high nutritional value, dietary fiber, resistant starch, rutin, D-chiro-inositol,
vitamins, and minerals. D-Chiro-inositol, fagopyritols (galactosyl derivatives
of D-chiro-inositol) and resistant starch. Rutin and quercetin are the   main
antioxidants in buckwheat and have been mentioned in the treatment of
chronic venous insufficiency. The main nutritional value of buckwheat
groats (dehulled seeds) is like that of cereals. Starch and fiber are present
in similar amounts, and buckwheat also contains a high level of
polyunsaturated essential fatty acids such as linoleic acid. Several vitamins
(B1, C, and E) are present, whereas minerals are present in abundance. In
comparison to cereals, buckwheat protein is of high nutritional quality due
to its relatively high level of lysine. </p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>    Teff is an intermediate between a tropical and temperate grass. The use of
teff can be traced back to about 3359 BC. In contrast to amaranth, which
was utilized by early civilizations throughout the world, teff production and
uses have been primarily restricted to the countries of Ethiopia, India and
its colonies, and Australia. While teff grain still provides over two-thirds of
the human nutrition in Ethiopia, it is relatively unknown as a food crop
elsewhere. Teff has adaptive characteristics similar to other crops grown by
early civilizations. Teff has a very high calcium content, and contains high
levels of phosphorous, iron, copper, aluminum, barium, and thiamine. Teff
is low in gluten and therefore, the bread remains quite flat..  </p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>    Sorghum is a tropical grass grown primarily in semi-arid parts of the world
and has similar composition to corn with more iron content than wheat.
Sorghum grain contains about 1.5 ppm of total carotenoids. Apart from
maize and durum wheat, sorghum is the only cereal which contains a
significant amount of β- carotene, the provitamin of vitamin A, which is
important in human physiology. Sorghum is a good source of fibre, mainly
the insoluble (86.2%) fibre. The insoluble dietary fibre of sorghum and
millet may decrease transit time and prevent gastrointestinal problems. </p>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12">
          <p>    Amaranthus species were grown as the principle grain crop by the Aztecs
5,000 to 7,000 years ago. Synonyms such as &quot;mystical grains of the
Aztecs,&quot; &quot;super grain of the Aztecs,&quot; and the &quot;golden grain of the Gods&quot;
were used to describe the nutritious amaranth grain. Amaranth grain is
considered to have a unique composition of protein, carbohydrates, and
lipids. Grain amaranth has higher protein (12 to 18%) than other cereal
grains and has a significantly higher lysine content.  </p>
